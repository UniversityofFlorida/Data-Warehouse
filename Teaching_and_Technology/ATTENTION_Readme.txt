Anyone that would like access to the CS_Data and CS_Views file creation scripts, These are stored in a private Bitbuck repository:  https://bitbucket.org/ufonline/cs-data/

If you do not have a bit bucket account, please contact me at @mronco@ufl.edu and we can provide the scripts to you via another delivery mechanism. (FileExpress, SharePoint, etc.)
